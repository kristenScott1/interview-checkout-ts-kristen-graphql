# Odeko Checkout interview project

## Project description

Implement an online checkout flow. We started the frontend app. You can find
some info on how to use it in [the original readme][cra] generated by
create-react-app. You'll need Yarn and a relatively recent version of Node.js.

We implemented the backend server for you. We'll send you a link to your account
where you can create an API key. Keep it secure!

You can choose between using the HTTP or GraphQL endpoints. They're functionally
identical.

- [Interactive GraphQL docs](https://secret-shore-94903.herokuapp.com/graphiql)


## Instructions

- You must use React for this project, but feel free to add, replace, or redo
  anything else you'd like.
- We will be reviewing your solution commit-by-commit so that we can understand
  your thought process. So instead of putting everything in a single giant
  commit, make frequent cohesive commits so we can see what your work
  progression looks like.
- Don't spend more than 3 hours on this project. It's okay if you don't finish
  all of the [feature requirements](#feature-requirements). If you do decide to
  use more time, let us know what you worked on before and after those 3 hours.
- Leave comments in places where you weren't quite sure if you were solving the
  problem correctly to let us know that you've thought about it and made a
  conscious decision.
- Provide working instructions for how to run your application, and make sure
  that the application will run on someone else's machine.
- Fulfill the [feature requirements](#feature-requirements) below. Let us know
  when you're done and open a PR for review. Good luck!
